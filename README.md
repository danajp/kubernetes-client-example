# Kubernetes Client Examples

There are several ways to interact with kubernetes in go. I can
never remember how to do it.

This repo contains some example code for instantiating and using
kubernetes clients in go.

## Docker image

Prebuilt docker image is available on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/danajp/kubernetes-client-example).
